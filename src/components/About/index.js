            Wholeness Collective Therapy Group, a boutique therapy center
            located in Carlsbad Village, California, offers holistic
            psychotherapy services both virtually (for CA residents) and
            in-person. Our therapists use an eclectic approach by incorporating
            traditional psychotherapeutic modalitiesâ€” psychodynamic,
            cognitive-behavioral, and narrative - with mindfulness-based
            practices, somatic (body-based) therapies and EMDR (trauma therapy).

            Collectives clinical director and founder, Janelle Nelson, M.A.
            hand-selects each therapist and coach. She provides direct
            supervision to ensure that each client receives comprehensive care.
